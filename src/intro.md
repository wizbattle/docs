# Introduction

This manual is the primary source of documentation for wizbattle, both for
developers and regular players. It describes the game features, the inner
workings and the future plans for the project.

## What is wizbattle?

wizbattle is an online game which simulates Wizard101 combat mechanics. It
is fully open source under the GNU GPLv2 license.

The primary mechanic is PvP with access to gear and spells without grinding,
which allows rapid testing and adapting of strategies.

We feature various metagames, one of them being the official ingame ladder,
but also various customized modes where people can time-travel or use
inaccessible spells and gear.
